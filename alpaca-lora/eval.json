This will allow the can to rotate on itself. Close the pouring opening by using a knife or other thin object, bending the opening back up so it almost where it was before the beverage can was opened.\nStep 2: Nozzel Jets\nMake a couple of holes in the side of the can, about half way up, opposite each other using a small drill. The diameter of the holes should be about the same as the thin plastic tubing to be used as jet nozzles. Enlarge the holes so they are elliptical allowing the nozzle tubes to lie parallel against the cans side.\nStep 3: Making a Pressure Vessel\nSeal the top of the opened can using super glue and baking soda to make a small pressure vessel. Add some super glue to the closed opening and then sprinkle on some baking soda - they will combine to make a plastic. Keep adding super glue and baking soda until the top is sealed.\nStep 4: Attaching the Nozzle Jets\nFit in the thin plastic tubes to the holes drilled in the sides of the can and seal with super glue and baking soda. Try to have the tubes pointing horizontal in the direction you want to rotate the can when the steam exits the nozzles.\nStep 5: Creating Steam\nAdd a little water into the can though one of the nozzles.

It isn't until Daisy admits later that she had never really noticed the light that the facade began to slip. Nick, the narrator, starts to recognize it as a symbol of Gatsby's unhealthy desperation rather than his love. This is parallel to Gatsby's experience of the American Dream and money. Gatsby is unbelievably rich at the beginning of the novel. This solidifies his belief in the American Dream, though he still reaches for the acceptance of those who are wealthier and more popular. Nick believes money is not an object to Gatsby, though he has no idea how he made all of it. As the story unfolds and the mystery and mystique around Gatsby fade, so does Gatsby and Nick's blind belief and trust in the American Dream. After Gatsby is murdered, the green light is symbolic of the ways that money and affluence ruin the lives of those without.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "alpaca_lora_prediction": "This paper introduces FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, the authors find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, the authors guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information", "stanford_alpaca_prediction": "This paper introduces FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding, and guides slot with explicit intent information and proposes a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing."}, {"id": 182, "instruction": "You will need to compose the ABC notation for a given song.", "input": "The South Wind", "alpaca_lora_prediction": "ABC: The South Wind", "stanford_alpaca_prediction": "X:435\nT:Southwind\nR:WALTZ\nM:3/4\nL:1/4\nQ:1/4=68\nK:G\n|:d/c/|\"G\" B3/2 A/2 G|Bcd|\"D\" (A3 |A2) d/c/|\"G\"B3/2 A/2 G|\"C\" EDE|\"G\"(G3|G2) d/c/|!\n|\"G\" B3/2 A/2 G|Bcd|\"D\" A3/2 (3G/F/G/|\"D\"  A2 d/c/| \"G\" B3/2 A/ G| \"C\" EDE | \"G\" (G3|G) B d|!\n\"G\" g2 g| \"C\" g3/2 f/ e| \"G\" (d3|\"D\"d2) d/c/|\"G\" B3/2 A/ G| B c d| \"D\" (A3|A2) d| \"C\" g2 g|!\n\"C\" g3/2  f/ e| \"G\" d3| \"G\" d2 c| \"G\" B3/2 A/ G| \"D\" A/ c3/2 F| \"G\" (G3|G2):||"}, {"id": 183, "instruction": "Categorize the given magazine based on its content into one of the categories: Politics, Entertainment News, Tech News, Business News, Parenting & Kids, Health & Healing, Cooking, Food & Wine, and Arts & Literature,", "input": "Inc.", "alpaca_lora_prediction": "Business News", "stanford_alpaca_prediction": "Business News"}, {"id": 184, "instruction": "Decide if the given email belongs to the Promotions or Social category.", "input": "Subject: You have an invitation\nEmail: Hi, I'd like to join your LinkedIn network.", "alpaca_lora_prediction": "Social", "stanford_alpaca_prediction": "Social"}, {"id": 185, "instruction": "The story of a movie has been described using many emojis.
