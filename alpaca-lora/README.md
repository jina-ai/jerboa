# Jina AI alpca lora fork


This folder is the fork of the great [alpaca lora](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) repo. 


the rest of this readme is the original README from the repo.


## Jina specific stuff

!!! To follow the rest be sure to have enabled your virtual env with poetry by looking at the top root README.md 


### debug mode

We can run the code in debug mode, this allows to test the code with low resource (small model and small dataset)

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python finetune.py --debug
```

this still use wandb. If you want to disable wandb you can do

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python finetune.py --debug --use-wandb=False
```

## Distributed training
It is possible to train the model on multiple GPUs. This allows to train the model faster.
Training on 2x3090 GPUs: 

```bash
WORLD_SIZE=2 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2 torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 --master_port=1234 finetune.py --base_model 'yahma/llama-7b-hf' --output_dir './lora-alpaca' --batch_size 128 --micro_batch_size 4 --eval_limit 30 --eval_file eval.jsonl --wandb_log_model true --wandb_project jerboa --wandb_run_name jerboa-intial-train --wandb_watch gradients  --num_epochs 3
```

Training on 3x3090 GPUs: 

```bash
WORLD_SIZE=3 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2 torchrun --nproc_per_node=3 --master_port=1234 finetune.py --base_model 'yahma/llama-7b-hf' --output_dir './lora-alpaca' --batch_size 128 --micro_batch_size 4 --eval_limit 30 --eval_file eval.jsonl --wandb_log_model true --wandb_project jerboa --wandb_run_name jerboa-intial-train --wandb_watch gradients  --num_epochs 3
```

## Training Datasets
Currently, the training pipeline supports 2 training datasets:
- `yahma/alpaca-cleaned`: cleaned version of the alpaca dataset, available on the HF datasets hub. This is the used dataset by default
  - `code_alpaca_20k.json`: a dataset of 20k code snippets, available locally. To use this dataset, specify the following parameter in the training command: `--data_path ./code_alpaca_20k.json`


## Tests

You can run our tests by doing


```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 pytest test_finetune.py
```


this should take a couple of second to run on a singe 3090. Just doing one epoch over 100 data points


## Evaluation
To run evaluation you first need an evaluation file or dataset.
This evaluation looks like the following:

```bash
{"id": "user_oriented_task_0", "motivation_app": "Grammarly", "instruction": "The sentence you are given might be too wordy, complicated, or unclear. Rewrite the sentence and make your writing clearer by keeping it concise. Whenever possible, break complex sentences into multiple sentences and eliminate unnecessary words.", "instances": [{"input": "If you have any questions about my rate or if you find it necessary to increase or decrease the scope for this project, please let me know.", "output": "If you have any questions about my rate or find it necessary to increase or decrease this project's scope, please let me know."}]}
```

You can download self-instruct evaluation data using this command:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/main/human_eval/user_oriented_instructions.jsonl
```

To run evaluation after finetuning you can use the following command:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 \
python finetune.py \
  --base_model 'yahma/llama-7b-hf' \
  --data_path <Your-data-path> \
  --output_dir './lora-alpaca' \
  --wandb_project 'jerboa' \
  --wandb_run_name 'test-run' \
  --wandb_watch 'gradients' \
  --wandb_log_model 'true' \
  --num_epochs '2' \
  --eval_file 'user_oriented_instructions.jsonl' \
  --eval_limit '5'
```

--eval_file: path to the evaluation file<br>
--eval_limit: number of examples to evaluate on

Evaluation results will be automatically logged to wandb.

- ü§ó **Try the pretrained model out [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tloen/alpaca-lora), courtesy of a GPU grant from Huggingface!**
- Users have created a Discord server for discussion and support [here](https://discord.gg/prbq284xX5)
- 4/14: Chansung Park's GPT4-Alpaca adapters: https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/340

This repository contains code for reproducing the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) results using [low-rank adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf).
We provide an Instruct model of similar quality to `text-davinci-003` that can run [on a Raspberry Pi](https://twitter.com/miolini/status/1634982361757790209) (for research),
and the code is easily extended to the `13b`, `30b`, and `65b` models.

In addition to the training code, which runs within hours on a single RTX 4090,
we publish a script for downloading and inference on the foundation model and LoRA,
as well as the resulting [LoRA weights themselves](https://huggingface.co/tloen/alpaca-lora-7b/tree/main).
To fine-tune cheaply and efficiently, we use Hugging Face's [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft)
as well as Tim Dettmers' [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes).

Without hyperparameter tuning, the LoRA model produces outputs comparable to the Stanford Alpaca model. (Please see the outputs included below.) Further tuning might be able to achieve better performance; I invite interested users to give it a try and report their results.

### Local Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r old.requirements.txt
   ```

1. If bitsandbytes doesn't work, [install it from source.](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/blob/main/compile_from_source.md) Windows users can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/17).

### Training (`finetune.py`)

This file contains a straightforward application of PEFT to the LLaMA model,
as well as some code related to prompt construction and tokenization.
PRs adapting this code to support larger models are always welcome.

Example usage:

```bash
python finetune.py \
    --base_model 'yahma/llama-7b-hf' \
    --data_path 'yahma/alpaca-cleaned' \
    --output_dir './lora-alpaca'
```

We can also tweak our hyperparameters:

```bash
python finetune.py \
    --base_model 'yahma/llama-7b-hf' \
    --data_path 'yahma/alpaca-cleaned' \
    --output_dir './lora-alpaca' \
    --batch_size 128 \
    --micro_batch_size 4 \
    --num_epochs 3 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --cutoff_len 512 \
    --val_set_size 2000 \
    --lora_r 8 \
    --lora_alpha 16 \
    --lora_dropout 0.05 \
    --lora_target_modules '[q_proj,v_proj]' \
    --train_on_inputs \
    --group_by_length
```

### Inference (`generate.py`)

This file reads the foundation model from the Hugging Face model hub and the LoRA weights from `tloen/alpaca-lora-7b`, and runs a Gradio interface for inference on a specified input. Users should treat this as example code for the use of the model, and modify it as needed.

Example usage:

```bash
python generate.py \
    --load_8bit \
    --base_model 'yahma/llama-7b-hf' \
    --lora_weights 'tloen/alpaca-lora-7b'
```

### Official weights

The most recent "official" Alpaca-LoRA adapter available at [`tloen/alpaca-lora-7b`](https://huggingface.co/tloen/alpaca-lora-7b) was trained on March 26 with the following command:

```bash
python finetune.py \
    --base_model='yahma/llama-7b-hf' \
    --num_epochs=10 \
    --cutoff_len=512 \
    --group_by_length \
    --output_dir='./lora-alpaca' \
    --lora_target_modules='[q_proj,k_proj,v_proj,o_proj]' \
    --lora_r=16 \
    --micro_batch_size=8
```

### Checkpoint export (`export_*_checkpoint.py`)

These files contain scripts that merge the LoRA weights back into the base model
for export to Hugging Face format and to PyTorch `state_dicts`.
They should help users
who want to run inference in projects like [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
or [alpaca.cpp](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp).

### Docker Setup & Inference

1. Build the container image:

```bash
docker build -t alpaca-lora .
```

2. Run the container (you can also use `finetune.py` and all of its parameters as shown above for training):

```bash
docker run --gpus=all --shm-size 64g -p 7860:7860 -v ${HOME}/.cache:/root/.cache --rm alpaca-lora generate.py \
    --load_8bit \
    --base_model 'yahma/llama-7b-hf' \
    --lora_weights 'tloen/alpaca-lora-7b'
```

3. Open `https://localhost:7860` in the browser

### Docker Compose Setup & Inference

1. (optional) Change desired model and weights under `environment` in the `docker-compose.yml`

2. Build and run the container

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

3. Open `https://localhost:7860` in the browser

4. See logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

5. Clean everything up:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all
```

### Notes

- We can likely improve our model performance significantly if we had a better dataset. Consider supporting the [LAION Open Assistant](https://open-assistant.io/) effort to produce a high-quality dataset for supervised fine-tuning (or bugging them to release their data).
- We're continually fixing bugs and conducting training runs, and the weights on the Hugging Face Hub are being updated accordingly. In particular, those facing issues with response lengths should make sure that they have the latest version of the weights and code.
- Users with multiple GPUs should take a look [here](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/8#issuecomment-1477490259).
- We include the Stanford Alpaca dataset, which was made available under the ODC Attribution License.

### Example outputs

**Instruction**: Tell me about alpacas.

**Alpaca-LoRA**: Alpacas are members of the camelid family and are native to the Andes Mountains of South America. They are known for their soft, luxurious fleece, which is used to make clothing, blankets, and other items. Alpacas are herbivores and graze on grasses and other plants. They are social animals and live in herds of up to 20 individuals.

**Stanford Alpaca**: Alpacas are small, fluffy animals related to camels and llamas. They are native to Peru and Bolivia, and were first domesticated around 5,000 years ago. They are kept mainly for their fine, soft fleece, which is used to make knitwear and other garments. Alpacas are herd animals and live in small family groups, led by an older male. They are highly social animals and can form strong bonds with their owners.

**text-davinci-003**: Alpacas are a domesticated species of South American camelid, similar to llamas. They are native to the Andes Mountains in South America and are kept as livestock for their soft, luxurious wool. Alpacas are social animals and live in herds of up to 20 individuals. They are typically kept in small herds of two to five animals, and are relatively easy to care for. Alpacas are herbivores and feed on grass, hay, and other vegetation. They are also known for their gentle and friendly nature, making them popular as pets.
